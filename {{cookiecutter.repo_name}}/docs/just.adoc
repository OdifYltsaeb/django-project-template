For best developer experience this project adopts `Makefile` alternative rewritten in Rust called {just-url}[Just].
This is basically usual Makefile but without the "historical baggage" of early software engineers.

TIP: To list all available commands _just_ run `just`

You are able to run most of the commonly used commands with `just` commands.
See the link:Justfile[Justfile] for the source.
