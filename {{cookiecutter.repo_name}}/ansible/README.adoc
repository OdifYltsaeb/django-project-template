== Setup

To use this template, first ensure that you have
link:https://python-poetry.org/docs/[Poetry] available, and have generated an environment using `poetry install`

With `Poetry` and `ansible` installed, all `ansible` commands can be executed like:

[source,bash]
----
poetry run ansible-playbook --version
----

TIP: You can also start a subshell using `poetry shell`, and in that case can omit the `poetry run` prefix, and run `ansible-playbook` directly.
