=== Downloading server state to development environment

We have a playbook to download the media and or database from a remote server hosting the project.

WARNING: Using this playbook deletes the local database so back up `.data/postgresql` directory before if you
 need to preserve your current database.

TIP: If the project doesn't have s3 setup, be sure to use the <<db-tag>>, as otherwise the playbook will fail.

==== Pre-requisites

[#aws-cli]
link:https://pypi.org/project/awscli/[AWS Commandline interface]::
 If media storages is S3, then you must first install the aws-cli tool locally.
 The easiest way to do it is via pip: `sudo pip install awscli`.


==== tags

[#db-tag]
db::
    Download only the database state.

[#media-tag]
media::
    Download only the media files. Requires <<aws-cli>>

==== Usage examples
[source,bash]
----
poetry run ansible-playbook -v --limit test --tags db mirror.yml  # restores only the database
poetry run ansible-playbook -v --limit test --tags media mirror.yml  # restores only the media files
