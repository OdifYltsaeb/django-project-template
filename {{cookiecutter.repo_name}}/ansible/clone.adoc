=== Clone server

WARNING: Using this playbook deletes and overwrites the database on target server

We have a playbook to copy over one server to another. This is a dangerous operation, do not
try it if you don't know what you're doing, and never target a server that is already used
with it.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -v --limit target.thorgate.eu -e source_host=source.thorgate.eu clone.yml
----

This will::
* Download database from source server to local dump file
* Download media and private files from source server
* Upload database dump from target server
* Drop database on target server
* Restore database dump on target server
* Upload media files to s3 configured on target server

This operation doesn't require to stop project on source host, however it may still be useful +
to stop it when performing live migration to ensure that the DB and media are in consistent state.
