== Server Environment Variables ==

The `.env` file on the server is generated from the link:../roles/deploy/templates/environment[environment] template file.

The template context variables are defined in the `group_vars` and `host_vars` directory's, as well as the vault.

Ansible creates a backup with every change. The backup is located in the same directory.

This environment file is used by link:../../docker-compose.production.yml[docker-compose.production] as well as by the containers themselves.

See xref:../deploy.adoc#env-tag[Here] for more information on how to deploy just an update to the environment file.

Environment variables which are used inside a container service should be prefixed. Such as `DJANGO_` or `RAZZLE_`
