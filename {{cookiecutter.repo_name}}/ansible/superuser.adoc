=== Create superuser to server

WARNING: This feature only works with Django 3.0 or later.

We have a playbook to help user to create superuser to remote server hosting the project.

The role will ask for superuser email to use for creating it. Random password will be generated for you.
You can run the role with:

[source,shell]
----
poetry run ansible-playbook --limit test superuser.yml
----
