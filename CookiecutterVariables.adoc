== How to read the variables definition

In link:cookiecutter.json[] we use define all the variables used in the project.

[id=hidden_variables]
If the value stars with `_`::
it is not shown to the user.

If the value is an array::
It limits the the value to one of the values in the array. +
The first value in the array is the default value.

If the value is an just a string::
It is the default value. and the user can change it to any input.

[id=values_based_on_previous_values]
== Values based on previous values

Values in cookiecutter.json are rendered using jinja2 templates. This means that you can use previous values in the definition of the next one.

For example:
[source,json]
----
{
    "project_title": "My Project",
    "repo_name": "{{ cookiecutter.project_title | slugify }}",
}
----

== Adding new variables

When adding new variables to the project tempalte `cookiecutter.json` also add them to  `cookiecutter_variables_reference.adoc` file.

Include them in a `tag::my_cool_variable[]` blocks, so you can include the variable in the docs. +
Making the default value visible in teh documentation without having to update the docs manually.


TIP: Don't be afraid to add new variables, even if you're using an existing variable in the project, just <<values_based_on_previous_values, define a new variable based on the same value>> with a <<hidden_variables, _ prefix>> and use it. This will allow future dev to re-define just that use much easier.

[id=variables]
== CookieCutter variables

=== project_title

Public title of the project. +
This is used in docs, emails navbars, etc. Anywhere the project name is shown to the public this is used.

}
----

=== repo_name

TIP: If you're using `repo_name` or `project_title` in a new place in the projects where you're using it as a string and have the ability to import django.conf.settings, import the value from there instead of using this variable, so the code is the same for all generated projects.

Preferably lowercase codename, used for the directory structure and Python modules.

Used as the root for a lot of things. Including folder names and the core project name on servers.

=== gitlab_repo_url



*[Optional]* Gitlab repo url in format: https://gitlab.com/your-group/project-name.

This is used for deriving the Gitlab repository url to use when deploying or the default
Docker registry url used for the project. Additionally the CI badges in the README file
are created based on this value.

NOTE:  If this is not defined during the project creation/upgrade then one needs to manually update the
 repository variable inside `ansible/group_vars/all/vars.yml` file of the resulting project to the correct
 git repository url (SSH). Additionally, when `build_in_ci` is set to `yes` then the image urls in `environemnt`
 file need to be updated to correct values too.

WARNING: If you're using a nested group, then you should use the git@ format for the repo url. see link:https://gitlab.com/thorgate-public/django-project-template/-/blob/master/tests/test_filters.py#L86-L101[this test case].
